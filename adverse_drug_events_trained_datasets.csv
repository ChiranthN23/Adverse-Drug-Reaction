Given medical case reports extracted from MEDLINE, the task is to classify whether the case report mentions the presence of any adverse drug reaction. Classify your answers into non-adverse drug event and adverse drug event.

Positive Example 1 -
Input: A case is reported of a child with fatal pulmonary fibrosis following BCNU therapy.
Output: adverse drug event

Positive Example 2 -
Input: She responded well to Sodium valproate.
Output: non-adverse drug event

Negative Example 1 -
Input: The patient suffered from breathing trouble after taking azithromycin.
Output: serious

Negative Example 2 -
Input: The patient is feeling better at the hospital.
Output: wellness

Now complete the following example -
Input: Our experience of this case led us to conclude that: patients with pulmonary metastases may develop bilateral and/or recurrent pneumothoraces following chemotherapy; computed tomography scan is essential for defining the cause of SSP; and closed chest tube drainage remains the therapy of choice, while chemical pleurodesis may also be used to prevent recidivant SSP.
