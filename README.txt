Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Detection using AI

Project Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced, explainable AI framework capable of the early, accurate, and causal detection of potential Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). The system integrates and analyzes complex heterogeneous data sources, including:

Post-Market Surveillance Data: Reports from healthcare providers and regulatory agencies.

Unstructured Patient Feedback: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), doctorâ€™s notes, and patient reviews.

Social Media Discourse: Analyzing public concerns and trends related to drug safety.

The core challenge is to ensure high accuracy while overcoming data sparsity, mitigating bias, and ensuring the insights generated are clinically actionable and transparent.

Features

Multimodal Data Integration: Combines structured and unstructured data sources for robust ADR detection.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Extracts meaningful insights from unstructured text data.

Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models: Trained on diverse datasets for improved predictive performance.

Explainability & Interpretability: Uses explainable AI techniques to ensure model transparency.

Real-time Monitoring & Alerts: Provides timely warnings for emerging ADR trends.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for deep learning tasks)

Required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ADR-Detection-AI.git
cd ADR-Detection-AI

Dataset Preparation

Obtain post-market surveillance data from FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).

Collect social media and patient feedback datasets.

Format datasets into structured .csv files and place them in the data/ directory.

Model Training

Preprocessing

Run the data preprocessing pipeline:

python preprocess.py

Training the Model

python train_model.py

Evaluating the Model

python evaluate_model.py

Deployment

For real-time inference:

python api.py

API endpoints will be available at http://localhost:5000.

Ethical Considerations

Data Privacy: Ensuring compliance with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.

Bias Mitigation: Using diverse datasets to prevent bias in ADR detection.

Transparency: Providing explainable AI insights for clinical decision-making.
